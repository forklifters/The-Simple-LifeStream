This was a challenge for me...I had a hard time trying to think of a design for the beast, the beast being the female of course. Haha the more and more I started drawing her the more it started looking like the faun from Pan's Labyrinth. OTL I do have another pic of her with sort of a different design on my tumblr. The color scheme isn't all that different tho. The composition of this scene was based off of the part where Belle first meets the Beast and wishes to see his face. But, here the situation is where the beast almost kills the young man only to see that he isn't really afraid of her. She eventually offers him a rose. It was the first time in a long time a person has gotten so close to her.
